/*
Single responsibility principle (SRP)

*SRP states that, a class should have only one reason to change,
meaning it should have a single responsibility.

*This principle encourages you to create classes that do one thing and do it well.

*Lots of responsibilities make the class highly coupled,
harder to maintain and harder to understand.
